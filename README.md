# Generative BlendPose-LDM: Utility-Preserving Face Image Anonymization via $k$-Anonymous Latent Diffusion

Generative BlendPose-LDM, a framework for face image anonymization that leverages $k$-anonymity privacy guarantees with the capabilities of diffusion models to recover image quality. Our approach takes uniformly blended pose-guided and class-consistent $k$-anonymous images as input and recovers their visual fidelity via diffusion-based denoising guided by text prompts aimed to preserve non-identifying demographic features and visual latents for downstream analysis.
